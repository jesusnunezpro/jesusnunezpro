# 👋 Hi, I’m Jesús Núñez!

I'm a Foglight Support Engineer at Quest Software. I dabble in all sorts of stuff while working, but recently started to get a bit more serious about programming in Python.


- 👀 I’m interested in too many things to ennumerate.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to automate all sorts of stuff with Python, Office365, Azure and Google Cloud.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborate on any interesting projects.
- 📫 You can reach me at jesus.nunez.pro@gmail.com
